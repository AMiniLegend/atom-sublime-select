# Sublime Style Column Selection

Enable Sublime style 'Column Selection', allowing you to drag across lines to select a block of text with carets on each line.

Also similar to Texmate's 'Multiple Carets', or BBEdit's 'Block Select'

## Usage
Hold the modifier key then click and drag with the configured mouse button across multiple lines. Dragging vertically places carets on each line at that column; dragging horizontally as well selects the text on each line.

Default key combinations are:

|Platform |Modifier Key |Mouse Button |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
|Windows  |Alt          |Left         |
|OS X     |Option       |Left         |
|Linux    |Shift        |Left         |

## Settings
The modifier key and mouse button can both be configured from the package's settings page. Available options:

### Mouse Button
- Left
- Middle
- Right

### Key Trigger
- Shift
- Alt/Option
- Ctrl
- None
